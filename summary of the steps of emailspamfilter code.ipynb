    "classify the emails as spam and ham using the concepts of Machine learning.Spam filtering is a binary classification task.\n",
    "The task is to distinguish between two types of emails, “spam” and “non-spam”.The dataset is obtained from uci repository.\n",

    "    Using SVM we misclassify 31 spam as non-spam messages whereas we don't misclassify any non-spam message.\n",
    "    Hence it is concluded that the best model  is support vector machine with 98.3% accuracy.It classifies every non-spam message correctly (Model precision)\n",
